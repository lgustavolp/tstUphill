# QA Test Report – Patients Journeys & Localization

This document outlines the findings from the QA testing of UpHill’s **Patients Journeys** view and **Localization** features. It includes a summary of identified bugs and a backlog of recommended test scenarios for future coverage.

---

## Identified Issues (Bugs)

| Issue | Description |
|------ |------------ |
| **1. Filter by Communication Status not applied (Patients Journeys)** | Selecting a communication status under “More filters” does not refine the patient list. **Actual:** All patients remain visible regardless of the chosen status. **Expected:** Only patients with the selected status should be displayed. |
| **2. Name search is not accent-insensitive (Patients Journeys)** | Searching for a patient by name fails to match names with accented characters. Example: searching for "Joao" yields no results even though a patient "João Silva" exists. **Expected:** The search should be case-insensitive and accent-insensitive, returning "João Silva" for "Joao". |
| **3. No offline error alert on search failure (Patients Journeys)** | If the network is disconnected during a patient search, there is no user-facing error message or alert. The UI remains static with no feedback. **Expected:** The system should alert the user (e.g., a notification or modal) that it failed to fetch search results due to lost internet connection. |
| **4. Incomplete localization of UI labels (Localization)** | After switching the interface language to Portuguese (PT), some UI text remains in English. Example: the “More filters” button label and other menu items stay untranslated. **Expected:** All interface labels and buttons should appear in the selected language (PT). |
| **5. Language switch not fully dynamic (Localization)** | Changing the language from English to Portuguese does not instantly update already-loaded content. Example: patient list and status labels stay in English until manual refresh. **Expected:** All visible text should update to the new language immediately upon switching, without refresh. |

**Note:** These issues have been reported to the development team for resolution. Issues 4 and 5 indicate gaps in the internationalization (i18n) implementation.

## Backlog – Future Test Scenarios

Below are recommended test scenarios for future coverage (written in BDD Gherkin format):

---

### Scenario: Filter by each Communication Status (Regression)

**Given** I am on the Patients Journeys view with a list of patients  
**When** I filter patients by each available Communication Status (e.g., Completed, Scheduled, Cancelled) one by one  
**Then** Only patients with the selected status should be shown for each filter, and the total count reflects the filter selection  

---

### Scenario: Combined Name Search and Status Filter

**Given** a list of patients is displayed on Patients Journeys view  
**When** I enter a search query (e.g., a partial name) and apply a Communication Status filter at the same time  
**Then** The results should only include patients that match the search term and have the selected status. If none match, a "no results" message should appear  

---

### Scenario: “No Results” message for empty outcomes

**Given** I am on the Patients Journeys view  
**When** I search for a name or apply filters that yield no matching patients  
**Then** I should see a clear “No results found” message (in the correct language)  

---

### Scenario: UI language switch updates all text

**Given** the application is in English and displays various UI labels and patient data  
**When** I switch the language to Portuguese via the language selector  
**Then** All interface text (headers, buttons, labels, notifications) updates to Portuguese immediately, with no residual English content  

---

### Scenario: Language preference persistence

**Given** I have set the application language to Portuguese  
**When** I log out and log back in (or navigate away and return)  
**Then** The interface language should remain Portuguese (last selected language remembered), ensuring a consistent experience for the user  

---

### ✅ Next Steps

Covering these future scenarios will strengthen the test suite by expanding edge case coverage and ensuring **full localization and usability validation**. All future scenarios should use BDD tags (e.g., `@regression`, `@i18n`) for inclusion in the nightly regression run.
